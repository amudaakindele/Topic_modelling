# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling on Facebook Comments

In this project, we explore sentiment analysis and topic modelling techniques on Facebook comments. I  gained insights into the opinions and attitudes of users towards a particular topic or product on Facebook.


Data Collection


I collected Facebook comments using the Facebook Graph API. The comments were collected from various public pages and groups related to the topic of interest. The comments were stored in a CSV file along with the name of the page/group and the timestamp of the comment


In this project, I demonstrated how sentiment analysis and topic modelling can be used to gain insights into the opinions and attitudes of users towards a particular topic or product on Facebook. The approach can be applied to any topic or product on Facebook to gain valuable insights into user sentiment and opinions.
